# Three Generations Seeking Romance — Age & Generation Prediction using Regression & Classification  
Using Machine Learning & NLP on the OKCupid Dataset  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores whether a user's online dating profile can predict:

1. **Their age** (Regression)  
2. **Their generation** — *Millennial, Gen X, or Boomer* (Classification)

Using a dataset of ~60,000 anonymized OKCupid user profiles, we apply data cleaning, feature engineering, NLP (TF–IDF), and machine learning models to build predictive systems for both tasks.

At the time the dataset was created (~2011–2012), generations were defined as:
- **Millennial:** 18–32  
- **Gen X:** 33–47  
- **Boomer:** 48–70  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The OKCupid dataset contains both structured and unstructured features:

### **Structured (categorical/numeric):**
- age, sex, body_type, diet, drinks, drugs  
- education, job, ethnicity, religion  
- height, income, orientation, status  
- location, sign, smokes  

### **Unstructured text:**
- **essay0 – essay9** (long-form personal descriptions)

The text features are later merged into a single field: `essay_all`.

## 🧹 1. Data Preparation  

### **1.1 Missing Values**
- Filled numerical missing values:
  - `height` → median  
  - `income` → -1 (unknown)
- Filled categorical missing values with `"Unknown"`
- Filled essay fields with empty strings  
- Dropped users with missing age values  

### **1.2 Essay Consolidation**
- Combined all `essay0`–`essay9` columns into a unified text column: `essay_all`
- Removed the original essay columns

### **1.3 Generation Creation**
Created a new classification target using age ranges:

| Age Range | Generation |
|-----------|------------|
| 18–32     | Millennial |
| 33–47     | Gen X      |
| 48–70     | Boomer     |

Encoded as `generation_encoded` for modeling.

## 🛠️ 2. Feature Engineering & Encoding  

### **TF–IDF for Text**
The combined essay text (`essay_all`) was converted to a numerical representation via:  
```python TfidfVectorizer(max_features=500, stop_words="english") ```python
### **One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Variables**
Categorical features were encoded using:
```python OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore")```python

Numeric Features (Passthrough)
Numeric variables such as height, income, etc. were passed directly to the model without any scaling, as tree-based models do not require normalization.
ColumnTransformer Workflow
A unified ColumnTransformer was built to process all feature types simultaneously:
Numeric features → passthrough
Categorical features → OneHotEncoder
Text feature (essay_all) → TF-IDF with 500 features
This automated preprocessing ensures consistent transformation during training and prediction.

🤖 ## 3. Modeling
3.1 Train–Test Split
Both regression (age prediction) and classification (generation prediction) tasks used an 80/20 split:
train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
3.2 Regression Models (Age Prediction)
Regression models trained:
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Linear Regression
Metrics Used
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
MSE (Mean Squared Error)

➡️ Gradient Boosting Regressor performed the best.

3.3 Classification Models (Generation Prediction)
Classification models trained:
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Logistic Regression
Metric Used
Accuracy

➡️ Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (~69%).

📊 ## Visualizations
The notebook also includes:
Age histogram
Generation countplot
Confusion matrices
Performance comparison tables
These visuals help interpret both the dataset and model performance.

📈 ## Key Insights
Text features (essays) add significant predictive value when processed with TF-IDF.
Age prediction achieves an average error of 5–6 years, which is strong considering noisy user-generated text.
Generation classification achieves ~68–69% accuracy, indicating moderate predictability.
Ensemble models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) perform consistently well.
Logistic Regression surprisingly outperforms tree models for generation classification.
